    <h2 id="first-heading">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person
        couldn't. So in order to be a superhero<b>, you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal
            human
            being could possess,</b> and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or
        a
        fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular
        police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it's a good guy with a superpower who is
        fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being
        couldn't do, couldn't accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.<br>
